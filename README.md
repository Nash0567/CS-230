1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a game developer looking to create a web-based version of their application "Draw it or Lose It". They wanted the application to be compatible across multiple platforms, as well as with multipe input devices.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
My documentation is a good framework of  the steps and decisions that shoud be made, in order to create there desired game. I also incorporated the singleton process to ensure there can only be one instance of the game open at a time.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Using a design document providdes a structure to assist in developing code, by defining the software's architecture and requirements.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could improve one aspect of my documentation, I would choose the Domain Model section. I would add a little more detail about each class's attributes and methods, which is something I have struggled with fully understanding. It will also benefit other developers that will use the documentation. It will provide them with a clearer outline and understanding.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The game has requirements to be playable on multiple platforms and be scalable. The game should be consistent across all devices and input devices. Addressing the user's need fot smooth consistent gameplay is what I focused on and it will result in better user satisfaction.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
7. The design used the Singleton Pattern as previously mentioned and Iterator to streamline the code structure. In the future, I plan on using UML diagrams in greater detail, while also incorporating design documentation from the beginning. Having a plan from the start always makes things easier. Having done these things, they will only become easier in the future.
